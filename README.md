SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python 🌊🔍

Welcome to the SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project! 🚢⚓️ This Python-based machine learning project is designed to predict whether an object detected by SONAR technology is a rock or a mine. Dive into the depths of data analysis and classification algorithms to distinguish underwater objects.

Features: 

-Dataset Exploration: In-depth analysis of the SONAR dataset to understand the characteristics of rocks and mines.

-Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classification algorithms such as: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Networks.

-Model Evaluation: Thorough evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

-Data Visualization: Visual representations of data patterns and model predictions.
